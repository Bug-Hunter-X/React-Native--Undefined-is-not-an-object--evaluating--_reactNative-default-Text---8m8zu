The solution is to correctly import and define the component. Ensure that the component is imported at the beginning of your file using `import { MyComponent } from './path/to/MyComponent';` and that you have defined `MyComponent` correctly in the corresponding file. Make sure the path to the component is correct. If you are using a third-party library, double check its installation.
