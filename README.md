# React Native Undefined Component Error

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: rendering an undefined component.  The error message typically looks like this:

`undefined is not an object (evaluating '_reactNative.default.Text')`

This error happens when a component is used before it's properly imported or defined within the required scope.  The example shows this error and how to fix it.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` (depending on your platform).
4. Observe the error message in the console and the app's behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves double-checking that the component is properly imported and defined. The `UndefinedComponentSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.
